1. What is the intention of this project?
To provide an interface that allows the interaction of a computer (to program) hands free, without mouse and keyboard, via speech.
2. What is the driving insight to this project?
The end-goal of high-level programming languages, as well as computer programming in general, is to provide an accessible that is as natural to human speech as possible. In other words, to be able to speak and have a computer intuitively do is the ultimate goal of computer linguistics study and computer programming on a whole. High-level languages have been designed to achieve that goal. Speaking to perform actions is a future evolution and vision of that goal.
3. What key principles should guide the project?
Accessibility, simplicity, & ease-of/intuitiveness-of use
4. What personal insights do the researchers hope to gain?
An increased fluency in C/C++, incorporation of external APIs, and understanding of systems-software, unconventional I/O & data, and an applicable project that brings value and insight to society and emerging technologies.
5. What value does this project contribute to society?
Contribution to society should be a driving motivator in all intent of an increasingly interwoven society. This project aims to explore the implementation of that end-game goal of computer linguistics, exploring emerging technologies (AI speech to text & speech interpretation), and contribute a valuable capstone of those ideals. To explore vision in computer science and actualize on a world of technology accessible, in all it's power, to everyone. Enabling speech to programing, without interaction with a computer, is broadening a horizon of accessibility for all that is deep-rooted in the evolution of the miraculous revolution of computing.
